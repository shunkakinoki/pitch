# The all-in-one serverless backend infrastructure of your dreams

---

## Mission

Empower all developers with the cutting-edge backend technology with ease.

---

## Problem

- Cloud functions are broken (Cold starts, edge, versioning)
- Backend infrastructure devops work is mundane (Expensive, mundane, pricy)
- Cloud functions plugins to automatically deploy boilerplate code
- No existing solution that tangles both serverless functions with database infrastructure

---

## Solution

- Abstract away cloudflare workers + fauna db
- Write all database logic in code (indexes, mutations, query)
- Preview infrastructure in pull requests
- Dashboard with admin, analytics, & auth built in
- Cronjobs, queue, flags and other invocation functionality
