# Interval Time Management Hardware

---

## Mission

Empower individuals to make the most of the time we scarcely have left

---

## Problem

- Time-management is very analog, yet very conflictive
- No dedicated hardware solution to maximize people's time
- Lifeops solution based on time doesn't exist currently

---

## Solution

- HOD-like solution to be subconsciously aware of time
- Lifeops-based solution to integrate with software
- Maximize people's time that we scarcely have left on the face of the earth
