# Personality Development Education Subscription SaaS

---

## Mission

Raise the Global Standard of Personality Development

---

## Problem

There isn't a way to teach people about personality development

- No one teaches us the required social skills in life
- Rather they are passively acquired through life in general
- Studies suggest that personality traits contribute more to success than IQ

---

## Solution

- Proactive content with AR/VR/AI
- Subscription based education software through apps
- Make sure no one is left behind
