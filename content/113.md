# Support for OSS Integration

---

## Mission

Accelerate the adoption of OSS projects through proprietary support

---

## Problem

- OSS projects are heavily underutilized
- Lack of insight regarding how to implement them into enterprise development
- Continuous support for oss projects is scarce

---

## Solution

- Integration is necessary, but no pre-determined solution exists
- Initial OSS continuous integration is a pain
- Pre-determined projects for one-stop solution regarding a variety of enterprise-grade projects
