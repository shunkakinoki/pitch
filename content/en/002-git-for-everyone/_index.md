# Git For Everyone

---

## Mission

Democratize `git`

---

I truly believe that `git` should be used for any purpose

- business writing
- knowledge sharing
- education (essays, paper, etc...)

---

## Problem

- Heavily based on CLI
- A high learning curve
- Unintuitive, high-barrier, geared towards coders

---

## Solution

- Intuitive UI & UX for everyone
- Sync with git & integrate with github
- Open-Source code
