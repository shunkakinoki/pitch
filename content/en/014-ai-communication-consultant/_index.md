# AI Communication Consultant

---

## Mission

Empower the world with the aid of your own private communication consultant

---

## Problem

- Person-to-person communication is as important as ever, yet we do not have a systematic workflow to acquire it
- Increasingly more and more people are being judged by AI? Then shouldn't the AI be in charge of training us too?
- People's behaviors are not always rational in social opportunities

---

## Solution

- Affordable, Private, & Ubiquitous Private Communication Consultant
- Training with apps or AR/VR as a practice field
- `Personal-training as a service` pioneer -> 50 years later, would be still be organic as we are today?
