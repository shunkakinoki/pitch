# Consumer First Influencer

---

## Mission

Bring out the power of non-influencers for a better and generic consumer experience

---

## Problem

- Marketing utilizing influencers are becoming out of fashion - too fancy
- Hidden need for normal people to sponsor generic content
- Influencer's lives are not within the reach of normal people

---

## Solution

- Have normal people provide authentic reviews for generic feedback & marketing
- Let close friends influence your consumer experience, not elaborate celebrities
- More authentic reviews to provide truthful consumer experiences
