# Sharing for Screentime

---

## Mission

Empower individuals to live a more productive lifestyle through social awareness

---

## Problem

- No de-facto standard for sharing and competing against others regarding screen-time metrics
- Analytics are not geared toward individuals for better performance
- No use of social competitiveness for analytics-driven lifeops

---

## Solution

- Social awareness driven platform for better performance
- Rankings to get the most performance out of yourself
- Compete with others to "conquer the day" through analytics and insight
