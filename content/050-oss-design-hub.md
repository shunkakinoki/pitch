# OSS Design Hub

---

## Mission

Establish an OSS world to literally design a better future

---

## Problem

- Most great designs share the same components, yet they are heavily under-utilized
- Great design patterns have great reproducibility, yet very closed
- Difficult for designers to get exposure in the internet

---

## Solution

- Github for the OSS design community for a better experience as a whole
- Publishing made for non-commercial whilst providing user data for analytics
- Design projects to integrate outside for a team priced plan
