# Engineering Cycle Chatbot

---

## Mission

Empower your talented engineers to focus more on the codebase, not the bullshit

---

## Problem

- Engineering cycle is often delayed vastly by the text-base communication
- Pull-request & issue management is a huge pain for core maintainers
- No comprehensive automated solution to fasten and focus on the crucial code

---

## Solution

- Empower engineers through chatbots to provide a dedicated report on which part of code to focus the most
- Simplify and maintain a certain standard of engineering management through automated chatbots
- Analytics and dashboard for more critical insight regarding the engineering team
