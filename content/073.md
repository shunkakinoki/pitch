# Emotional Reminisce SaaS

---

## Mission

Revive those emotional moments to keep you driving throughout the day

---

## Problem

- Emotions are not perpetual and are rather volatile
- `Moments` disappear with time, people, and emotion itself
- Motivation cannot be easily acquired throughout the day, needs an occasional burst

---

## Solution

- Revive those moments as a driving force for yourself
- Invite and share with others for more realistic and pragmatic driving force
- Constantly remind yourself why you are doing this as your daily physiological passion
