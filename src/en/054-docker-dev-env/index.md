# Docker Dev Env

---

## Mission

Connect and unify developer experience through streamlined environments

---

## Problem

- Building dev environments shouldn't be a problem in 2020
- Different dev styles leading to increased workloads
- Experience isn't unified throughout the community

---

## Solution

- OSS based `vscode` and `docker` or `kubernetes` based dev env in browser
- Ability for chatting, coding, `zenhub` integration for the best experience possible in 2020
- `All code should be managed on the browser`
